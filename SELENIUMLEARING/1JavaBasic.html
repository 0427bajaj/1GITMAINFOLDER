JAVA INTRO, INSTALLATION

INTRO-----------------------------------------<BR><P>
<BR>
Automation: Selenium Webdriver 
Communicate with- browse
Mimic all activities- we wan to perform
Instruction will be provided- through test script (test cases with logic)
Language- core java, c#, python, core java
Community support
Browser> selnium webdriver>core java> test script> repos
Github- code is added to git with jenkin or github to run automatically at particular time
<BR>
JAVA-----------------------------------------<BR><P>
<BR>
JAVA- Download : download JDK( java development kit)SE( standard edition)- linkhttps://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk24-windows, download exe file. click next next next on the exe file to install. in C drive under program file java folder will get created after download. you will see bin folder
JAVA-Set environment varible for java: 
copy the bin folder path> search on computer for enviornment variable> then click on enviornment varible on dialogue box> click new under user  variable> name will be JAV_HOME and path will be upto bin, for bin folder
JAVA-Check if java install on pc- window r/cmd- java -version ( java space dash version) eg: C:\Users\P3056738>java -version( most stable is 8th release)
<BR>
CLASS -----------------------------------------<BR><P>
<BR>
Test.java ( class test {}) name of file and name of class will be same with .java extention, to run the program/software call compiler who file check if there is no mistake and complier convert .java file to .class file/will be in byte code- then will run JRE on JVM( java runtime enviornment by java virtual machine in virtual envionment not on machine) interpreter will interpret and show the putput
EXECUTION OF CODE- COMPLIER & INTERPRETER- .java file> .class file created by complier/ in byte code if everything good> interpreter provider output on machine.
ECLIPSE: We need editor to write code/ eclipse/intelije, in google download eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ download from here , and download ide for java developer
<BR>
CREATE CODE WITHOUT ELLIPSE------------------------------------------<BR><P>
<BR>
write in note pad in core java
body of the class

<BR>
class Test {
    
    main static void main (string {} args){}
    --( its main method)
    -- this wholde is class body and inside we have method body 
    -- main method is used to execute and perform action

    system.out.print (" hello word");
    -- this will be used to print anything we want to, its get writen in "" quotes

    -- we do not write anything the method/logic other than variable

}
<BR>
>> we can write in notepad and save as class name +.java, eg: test.java and save anywhere on pc
>> to execute without exclipse, open cmd, by going into the folder then you will open the location or use cd to go to the folder where the code is 
>> one at location  write javac tester.java  and hit enter and .class file in folder will be created( complier will make file for interpreter to execute)
>> now call interpreter java test ( java and class name) and hit enter, it will show output
complitaion then interpreter will work 

JAVA PROCESSING-----------------------------------------<BR><P>
<BR>
>> WRITING SCRIPT IN JAVA ON ECLIPSE ETC-
code is written here
<BR>
>> COMPLIING PHASE/PREPREPRATION PHASE- COMPLIER WORK HERE
.class file get created
JAVA FILE>COMPLIER CHECK CODING VOIATION & SYNTAX ERROR AS PER JAVA FILE>BYTE CODE= class.file
<BR>
>> RUN TIME PHASE/ EXECUTION PHASE- INTERPRETER WORK HERE
.class file convert into .java file 
 JVM (java virtual machine) IN JRE (java runtime enviornment)WILL RUN CODE ON VIRTUAL PLATFORM, CLASS FILE WILL RUN 
NOT INTERPRETER WILL COME AND INTERPRET AND SHOW THE OUTPUT ON MACHINE
